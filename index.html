- Design a guessing game about you that involves **FIVE** yes/no questions. Be creative and fun and whimsical. Or not. It's up to you! It's your project!
- The questions in the guessing game must require a mix of yes/no answers, and user input must accept either y/n or yes/no responses, with either `.toUpperCase()` or `.toLowerCase()` used to validate the user input and accommodate users entering all-caps Y/N or YES/NO answers, too.
- Useful and descriptive `console.log()` messages in the JS are well written and correctly displaying to the browser console for each question of the guessing game.
- Use CSS to style your page as you see fit, to the level of abilities in CSS that you currently have
